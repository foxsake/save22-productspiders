The display has an ultra-narrow 3.3mm bezel, giving ZenFone 2 a remarkable 72% screen-to-body ratio for a maximised viewing experience, and is covered with Corning® Gorilla® Glass 3 for superior resistance to damage and fingerprints. An anti-fingerprint coating reduces friction by 30%, giving a luxuriously-smooth feel to touch gestures.<br>
<br>
ZenFone 2 is the world's first smartphone to give everyone the ability to completely customise it to match their personal style and usage preferences, including ASUS's ZenUI mobile user interface launcher, themes, fonts, icons, and more. ZenUI has many great new features — including ZenMotion, SnapView, Trend Micro™ security and ZenUI Instant Updates — that enhance usability; ensure security and privacy; and deliver a seamless user experience.<br>

<br>
<br>


<b>Battery power to keep up with you</b><br>
BlackBerry® is well known for amazing battery life.

<b>Your personal assistant</b><br>
BlackBerry® Assistant allows you to manage your email, contacts, calendar and other BlackBerry 10 features through voice and text commands. It helps you to execute tasks quickly such as responding to important emails, scheduling a meeting or getting directions.
<br>
BlackBerry Assistant is intelligent enough to respond to you based on your situation. Speak freely to it and it will respond in kind. Type a query and it will respond simply with information on the screen. When you’re connected to Bluetooth in the car, it knows you can’t look at the screen and will interact with you completely eyes and hands free.
<br>
<br>


<b>Phone calls come to life</b><br>
Phone calls on the BlackBerry® Passport are the next best thing to an in-person conversation. It comes with powerful speakers and a quad microphone system.

<b>All your messages in one place</b><br>
BlackBerry® Hub is the one place to manage all your conversations – email, text, BBM™, phone calls, social media and more. The all-new instant actions feature will allow you to quickly organize and action your inbox without having to go into each individual message. Plus, BlackBerry Priority Hub will get to know you and how you use your smartphone, curating a view of the most important messages and notifications.

	<li><b>Dual Front Cameras for Selfie and Groufie</b></li>

</ul>
</div>

<p>Natural design of a premium smartphone has arrived. Integrated with Dura Skin, the shiny stainless steel 316L frame, commonly used in luxury watches for years, provides a unique look and superior protection against dings and breaks. The amazing true-to-life images and authentic rich colors produced by the IPS Quantum Display highlights the final touch to this master piece. The LG V10 brings an unmatched experience and visual satisfaction.</p>

<p>Whether the main screen is on or off, the second screen keeps you up-to-date. When the main screen is off, it becomes your 24/7 billboard for basic information such as weather, date, time, and battery life, or for your personal signature to authenticate ownership. Swiping it allows immediate access to Quick Tools, an easy shortcut panel to Silent Mode, Wi-Fi, flash, and camera. When you turn on the main screen, it becomes a multitasking panel to quickly switch between recent apps, favorite contacts, music player and upcoming events.</p>

<p>Be adventurous and start recording while on the move. With the existing OIS camera and the new image processor, the LG V10 records images with more fluid motions allowing videos playback without motion blurs. Create professional videos without the shakes. Direct stories like an auteur and shoot like a pro. With Manual Video Mode, you can bring your imagination to life through film. Now you can master film in real time and do cool functions like color correction and manage picture quality. Be the cinematographer of your life and capture only your best memories.</p></span><ul id=""p_details""><li>Shipping Weight:<strong> 0.46kg</strong></li></ul></div></div>","LG V10 Dual-SIM H961N (Unlocked, 64GB, Luxe White)",http://www.expansys.com.sg/lg-v10-dual-sim-h961n-unlocked-64gb-luxe-white-285219/,LG,http://i2.expansys.com/img/b/285219/lg-v10-dual-sim-h961n.jpg,"http://i.expansys.com/i/b/b285219.jpg,http://i.expansys.com/i/b/b285219-1.jpg",285219,SGD,2016-03-09 03:37:56,True, 868.03,,"Home,Mobile Phones,Dual SIM Phones"

</div>
ASUS ZenFone 2 introduces new and evolved aesthetic refinements, including a graceful curved case, which has a textured diamond-cut polygonal design that tapers to an incredibly thin 3.9mm at the edges to lend ZenFone 2 a bold yet elegant look.  <br>
<br>
ZenFone 2 has an incredibly sharp and vivid 5.5-inch Full HD IPS display with a 403 ppi pixel density and a wide 178-degree viewing angle, ensuring lifelike photos and videos and great-looking apps. ASUS TruVivid technology enhances display performance even more with bright, brilliant colors. The display has an ultra-narrow 3.3mm bezel, giving ZenFone 2 a remarkable 72% screen-to-body ratio for a maximised viewing experience, and is covered with Corning® Gorilla® Glass 3 for superior resistance to damage and fingerprints. An anti-fingerprint coating reduces friction by 30%, giving a luxuriously-smooth feel to touch gestures.<br>
<br>
ZenFone 2 is the world's first smartphone to give everyone the ability to completely customise it to match their personal style and usage preferences, including ASUS's ZenUI mobile user interface launcher, themes, fonts, icons, and more. ZenUI has many great new features — including ZenMotion, SnapView, Trend Micro™ security and ZenUI Instant Updates — that enhance usability; ensure security and privacy; and deliver a seamless user experience.<br>

Reflecting LG’s longstanding reputation as a leader in smartphone cameras, the LG G5 has two cameras on the rear: one with a standard 78-degree lens and another with a 135-degree wide angle lens, the widest available in any smartphone. The 135-degree lens on the LG G5 offers a viewing angle that is approximately 1.7 times wider than those of existing smartphone cameras and 15 degrees wider than the human eye’s field of view. The wide angle lens makes it easier for users to capture more landscape, taller buildings or larger groups without having to position oneself further from the subject.</span><ul id=""p_details""><li>Shipping Weight:<strong> 0.46kg</strong></li></ul></div></div>","LG G5 (Unlocked, 32GB, Silver)",http://www.expansys.com.sg/lg-g5-unlocked-32gb-silver-288131/,,http://i1.expansys.com/img/b/288131/lg-g5.jpg,"http://i.expansys.com/i/b/b288131.jpg,http://i.expansys.com/i/b/b288131-1.jpg",288131,,2016-03-09 03:39:43,False,Price Not Announced,,"Home,Mobile Phones,SIM Free Phones,Android,Marshmallow 6.0"

</div>
ASUS ZenFone 2 introduces new and evolved aesthetic refinements, including a graceful curved case that tapers to an incredibly thin 3.9mm at the edges to lend ZenFone 2 a bold yet elegant look.  <br>
<br>
ZenFone 2 has an incredibly sharp and vivid 5.5-inch Full HD IPS display with a 403 ppi pixel density and a wide 178-degree viewing angle, ensuring lifelike photos and videos and great-looking apps. ASUS TruVivid technology enhances display performance even more with bright, brilliant colors. The display has an ultra-narrow 3.3mm bezel, giving ZenFone 2 a remarkable 72% screen-to-body ratio for a maximised viewing experience, and is covered with Corning® Gorilla® Glass 3 for superior resistance to damage and fingerprints. An anti-fingerprint coating reduces friction by 30%, giving a luxuriously-smooth feel to touch gestures.<br>
<br>
ZenFone 2 is the world's first smartphone to give everyone the ability to completely customise it to match their personal style and usage preferences, including ASUS's ZenUI mobile user interface launcher, themes, fonts, icons, and more. ZenUI has many great new features — including ZenMotion, SnapView, Trend Micro™ security and ZenUI Instant Updates — that enhance usability; ensure security and privacy; and deliver a seamless user experience.<br>

,"<div id=""description""><h2>Bose QuietComfort 25 Noise Cancelling Headphones Features</h2><div class=""trunc_wrap""><span itemprop=""description""><b>Headphones on. World off.</b>
<p>QuietComfort® 25 headphones are engineered to sound better, be more comfortable and easier to take with you. Put them on, and suddenly everything changes. Your music is deep, powerful and balanced, and so quiet
that every note sounds clearer. Even air travel becomes enjoyable, as engine roar gently fades away. No matter how noisy the world is, it’s just you and your music—or simply peace and quiet.</p>

<ul>
 <li>Significant noise reduction for travel, work and anywhere in between</li>
 <li>Deep, powerful sound for the music you love</li>
 <li>Lightweight around-ear fit you can wear all day long</li>
 <li>Control your music and calls with inline mic/remote</li>
 <li>Distinctive design, choose from Black or White</li>
</ul>

<b>Better by design</b>
<p>We've designed our industry-leading headphones with higher-quality materials and finishes. They're lightweight, and earcups rotate even more for a better fit. The headband sits closer to your head, with luxurious suede-like material underneath for extra comfort. If the AAA battery runs out, you can still enjoy music without noise reduction. And the earcups pivot to fit in a compact case that's easy to carry.</p>

<b>Less noise. More relaxing.</b>
<p>QC®25 headphones let you focus on what matters—your music, movies and videos. And they reduce what you don’t want to hear. Like a crowded city street. Cabin noise inside an airplane. Or a busy office. Advanced noise reduction technology and unique electronics make it happen. Even the ear cushions give you an extra level of quiet by sealing out some of the world around you.</p>

<b>True to life sound</b>
<p>Many of our engineers are also musicians, with a passion for music. So when you wear these headphones, you’ll hear ringing guitars. Soaring vocals as the chorus kicks in. Deep bass and crisp drums drive the beat forward. Bose® Active EQ and TriPort® technology deliver performance so compelling, you’ll want to listen for hours. And the fit’s designed so you can.</p>

<b>You’re in control</b>
<p>Whichever model QC25 headphones you choose (for Apple), the inline microphone/remote puts music and call controls at your fingertips. Many features are also compatible with today's most popular phones.</p>

<b>In the box</b>

<br>
<b>High Resolution Sound</b><br>
The M2L Headphones deliver Fidelio’s signature sound in high resolution directly to your iOS device, without distortion or crosstalk, thanks to a Lightning connector and built-in DAC. Enjoy pristinely detailed sound anywhere, in style.<br>
<br>
<b>Optimized 40mm neodymium drivers for pure authentic sound</b><br>
Each speaker driver is carefully hand picked, tuned and tested before being paired to ensure the most balanced natural sound. The 40mm drivers utilize high power neodymium magnets to deliver true high definition sound in a wide dynamic range, reproducing even the most minute details.<br>
<br>
<b>Acoustically sealed to keep sound details in, noise out</b><br>
The Fidelio headphone features an acoustic seal that's a specially designed ribbon lock built into the internal chamber, which eliminates any unnecessary sound leakage and preserves sound details. Not only do you get excellent bass extension, but also immersive enjoyment of every superb detail of your music, without environmental disturbances.<br>
<br>
<b>Bass Reflex System delivers clear, dynamic and balanced bass</b><br>
The headphone's acoustic closed-back architecture features a Bass Reflex System that essentially comprises ear-shells with strategically placed vents. These regulate the air pressure within the internal chamber, providing the diaphragm with a controlled environment for optimal acoustic response. Working in conjunction with the acoustic seal capture, every natural sound detail is isolated and precise and dynamic bass is delivered, without any compromising on sound clarity.<br>
<br>
<b>Enjoy high resolution audio on iOS devices</b><br>
The Philips Fidelio M2L lets you enjoy 24-bit 48kHz high resolution audio format streamed from your iOS device via the Lightning™ connector. The M2L ensures the ultimate listening experience, revealing every detail just as the artist intended.<br>
<br>
<b>Integrated DAC and amp for high resolution music anywhere</b><br>
The digital-to-analog converter (DAC) integrated into the Philips Fidelio M2L gives you the freedom and mobility to enjoy your high resolution music anytime, anywhere. No hassles with lugging extra gear when you're out and about.<br>
<br>
<b>Optimized Lightning™ connector for iOS devices (MFi certified)</b><br>
The Philips Fidelio M2L is fitted with a Lightning™ connector, which supplies a pure digital signal directly to the headphones. Keeping the signal digital helps to reduce crosstalk interference and improves stereo separation.<br>
<br>
<b>Deluxe memory foam cushions for an ergonomic fit</b><br>
The materials used for the Fidelio M2L have been carefully selected to ensure long-wearing comfort and enhanced sound performance. Memory foam earpads with breathable materials disperse pressure and heat build-up, so the Fidelio M2L headphones feel and sound exceptional.<br>
<br>
<b>Frequency response tuned to discerning listeners' preference</b><br>
Extensive research was done with discerning music lovers to gain insight to their listening preferences – for example, the optimal balance of sound characteristics that they favor. Our acoustic engineers then tuned the Fidelio M2L to take into account all the minute details that affect how listeners discern sound, such as how the ear reflects sound and resonates in response. As a result, we engineered our M2L headphones to reproduce sound that is as faithful to the original recording as possible - including current recording styles.<br>

,"<div id=""description""><h2>Parrot Zik 2.0 Wireless Headphones Features</h2><div class=""trunc_wrap""><span itemprop=""description""> <p><b>WIRELESS &amp; ERGONOMIC</b><br>
<b>When technology meets design</b><br>
To create the Parrot Zik 2.0, engineers collaborated with the French designer Philippe Starck to combine the best of audio and innovation into comfortable and trendy new headphones.<br>
Zik 2.0 are 17% lighter than the previous generation, the padded headband is thicker and more space is provided for your ears thanks to new ear cushions.<br>
<br>
<b>Bluetooth for wireless music and telephony</b><br>
Compatible with bluetooth enabled smartphones, tablets and computers: Parrot Zik 2.0 supports most audio codecs, especially AAC.<br>
Built-in NFC technology enables them to automatically connect via Bluetooth with NFC smartphones.<br>
<br>
<b>Extended listening time</b></p>

<p> </p>

<ul>
	<li>You can choose between 3 options for extended listening time:</li>
	<li>Flight mode: Up to 7 hours autonomy with ANC activated + line-in + Parrot Concert Hall effect</li>
	<li>Eco mode: Up to 7 hours autonomy with ANC activated + line-in + Parrot Concert Hall effect</li>
	<li>Regular mode: Up to 6 hours autonomy with ANC activated + Bluetooth + Parrot Concert Hall effect</li>
</ul>

<p><br>
<b>SMART-TOUCH PANEL</b><br>
<b>Simple and intuitive ergonomic</b><br>
Parrot developed a movement recognition algorithm designed to be more simple and intuitive for the user.<br>
Zik 2.0 has a head sensor in the ear cushion which automatically detects if you are wearing the headphones. As soon as you take off the Zik 2.0, the music stops!<br>
A tactile panel on the right ear cup allows you to control your music and hands-free calls.<br>
<br>
Control your music</p>

<p> </p>

<ul>

	<li>Adjust volume: Swipe your finger upwards or downwards to increase or decrease the volume</li>
</ul>

<p><b>STUNNING SOUND</b><br>
<b>Uncompromising audio quality</b><br>
To ensure music is heard in all its harmony and depth, Parrot Zik 2.0 audio playback offers full digital 32 bits audio processing. Frequency response is fully customisable with the 5 band pro-equaliser available on the free dedicated application Parrot Zik 2.0.<br>
<br>
<b>Parrot Concert Hall effect &amp; Equaliser</b><br>
The headset is equipped with powerful DSP (Digital Sound Processor) algorithms which reconstruct the sound giving you the impression that the music source is in front of you. Concert hall acoustics are recreated for harmonious and more natural sounds which also reduce fatigue. The Parrot Equaliser is a new, intuitive and fast way to adjust the music you are listening to, as well as offering you infinite settings options.<br>
<br>
<b>Smart Audio Tuning</b> Using tags from your audio files, Smart Audio Tuning in the Parrot Zik 2.0 free app automatically selects the most appropriate presets for you allowing the Parrot Zik 2.0 headphones to enhance your musical experience.<br>
If you want to create your own presets, the Parrot Zik 2.0 app lets you take control of all parameters, including the Parrot Concert Hall effect.<br>
<br>
<b>ADAPTIVE NOISE CONTROL</b><br>
<b>Uncompromising listening comfort</b><br>
Parrot offers a brand new and efficient active noise cancelling technology which adapts to your environment. Disturbing noises are eliminated whether you are at the office or in public transport for uncompromising listening comfort.<br>
<br>
<b>Enjoy a quiet environment</b><br>
6 microphones analyse residual noises (low frequencies) that could disrupt listening. Outside noise is then cancelled by opposing sound waves (anti-noise) in order to create a calmer environment.<br>
<br>
<b>Street Mode</b><br>
With Street Mode, stay connected to your environment while listening to your music. Zik 2.0 removes passive isolation effects (natural earpad isolation) to increase your perception of the environment around you. During calls, this mode offers you optimised listening comfort. The occlusion effect is removed to provide a natural perception of your own voice.<br>
<br>
<b>HANDS-FREE TELEPHONY IN HD</b><br>
<br>
<b>HD Voice</b><br>
Parrot Zik 2.0 lets you enjoy high definition hands-free calls with Bluetooth v3.0. The Sound quality is improved with HD Voice, it provides users with high-quality, crystal clear, more natural voice calls. HD voice needs to be supported by your smartphones and the phone operator.<br>
<br>
<b>Noise Reduction System</b><br>
The user's voice is captured by double microphones on each side and a bone conduction sensor. Surrounding noise is removed with a new Parrot Noise Reduction System algorithm.<br>
<br>
<b>Text-To-Speech for caller ID</b><br>
Parrot Zik 2.0 offers a vocal synthesis (Text To Speech) functionality for the selection of caller ID.<br>
<br>
<b>AUDIO PRESETS</b><br>
<b>Create and share your Presets</b><br>
Parrot Zik 2.0 are the only headphones offering the possibility to accurately customise the audio restitution. With the Producer mode, the Parrot Zik 2.0 ""mastering"" uses a 5 band full parametric equaliser with Parrot's proprietary spatialisation effect to recreate a real musical listening experience. You can also share your Presets with other Parrot Zik 2.0 users.<br>
<br>
<b>Artists Presets</b><br>
Parrot offers artists the possibility to define and share their settings in order to insure the perfect sound. Users can listen to music as heard by the artist. Follow your favourite artists through a dedicated page that features biographies and latest news about their work.<br>

<b>Your music says a lot about you. So do your headphones.</b>

<b>Powerful sound, lightweight design</b>

<p>SoundTrue headphones feature an advanced acoustic design for clear, natural audio across the full spectrum—from vocalists who hit the high note, right down to a good bass line groove.

<p>Meet the 'Art Décor' of audio equipment; there really is nothing like Collage. We give you a speaker that is refined, yet refuses to be ignored. Put it in your home and it becomes the center of your décor. It is part art, part interior design, part furniture, and part acoustics, all wrapped up in one tidy, beautidul package. Collage is a contrast of extremes, it seems subtle, yet the dynamic acoustics will overpower your senses. Collage is for the connoisseur of finer things, the lover of the sublime. It is truly a fine piece of 'Audio Art Engineering'.</p>
<h3>Art Décor</h3>
<p>This isn't just a speaker. This is a piece of modern art. Collage lives up to its name in every way-it's not only a tantalizing blend of materials, shapes and finishes, but it's so much more. It is a truly powerful wireless digital audio streaming device that can be the sound stage and even the solo performer in even large rooms with its powerful bass and stunning mid and upper registers. Collage is proof that speakers can and should be beautiful – inside and out.</p>
<h3>Audio Art Engineering</h3>
<p>Collage has some serious acoustic and electronic engineering packed inside. Not only does Collage boast the patented dual Electrostatz® tweeter arrangement, proprietary IC chipset for optimal electrostatic performance, DSP surround sound chipset, and CSR Bluetooth apt-X codec, but it also packs a powerful digital amplifier, two neodymium woofers and a passive radiator for even more bass response.</p>
<h3>Wall and Table Mounted</h3>
<p>Collage can fit every personalized taste. Its base stand sit on the table top or go with you around the house.  Collage gets to show off when you remove the detachable base and mount it on the wall. Not only will it become the center piece of your room, but the acoustic qualities will really shine because of the way the dipole Electrostatz® tweeters reverberate sound waves off  the wall. Bass will be more responsive, mid and high-range sounds will be sweeter and the whole acoustic experience will be anplified.</p>
<h3>Modern Industrial Design</h3>
<p>At IN2UIT, we design our speakers meticulously from the inside out-and Collage is no exception. It combines pure aesthetics and ease of wireless streaming from your device, from anywhere you feel comfortable. The industrial design emphasizes on intuitive user experiences. Collage provides you with a simpler listening experience. Collage was awarded honors in the prestigious IDEA Innovation and Design award 2012 and the CES Innovations and Engineering Excellence Awards in 2012.</p>
<h3>Color/Material/Finish (CMF)</h3>
<p>Collage is currently available in two color combos to match any décor in the home. Calm your senses with white and beige – a sophisticated color combination that blends quietly with a neo-modern interior for an authentic Scandinavian flavor. Collage also comes in stark contrast of black and red that's sure to be the highlight of any room.</p>
<h3>6.Spoil Your Aural Senses</h3>
<p>The aural senses are often the least exercised and most underdeveloped of the human senses. Electrostatic speakers, as audio lovers know, deliver the sweetest, most natural hi-fidelity experience audio technology has to offer. IN2UIT proudly presents the world's first electrostatic speaker that is compact and affordable. So sit back, relax, and treat your ears to the sounds of Collage.</p></span><ul id=""p_details""><li>Shipping Weight:<strong> 3.20kg</strong></li></ul></div></div>",IN2UIT COLLAGE Stereo Bluetooth Speaker (Deep Red + Charcoal Black),http://www.expansys.com.sg/in2uit-collage-stereo-bluetooth-speaker-deep-red-charcoal-black-249008/,IN2UIT,http://i2.expansys.com/img/b/249008/in2uit-collage-stereo-bluetooth-speaker.jpg,,249008,SGD,2016-03-09 03:45:57,False, 407.50,,"Home,Tablet PCs & iPads,Tablet Accessories,Headphones & Speakers"

<p>At IN2UIT, we know what a godsend the iPad can be for just about anything- business or pleasure-but we also know it has its quirks. Unfortunately the small speaker doesn’t do that beautiful Retina display any justice and can produce a shallow, tinny sound. BoomPack® really turns it up and enhances your experience until you’ll forget you’re using a tablet at all. The flip out Electrostatz® speakers provide amazing stereo and the bottom woofer packs a solid punch. And for business meetings, fold out the tweeters to show off their dipole acoustic effects that means everyone, in front and behind, can listen to your ultra-clear multimedia presentations. Add in an optional Bluetooth Keyboard to turn your iPad into a mobile workstation. At work or at home, BoomPack® raises the bar.</p>
<h3>iPad Entertainment Extravaganza</h3>
<p>Your iPad just got 100 times more fun. Finally, awesome sound to match that amazing Retina display. Watch movies, play games, and more with powerful, resonant stereo effects.</p>
<p>Pull out the fold-out Electrostatz® tweeters from the back of the case for personalized stereo hi-fi acoustics. It’s dipole so sound goes both ways.</p>
<h3>Always Use Protection</h3>
<p>We know how important it is to keep your iPad in top condition. BoomPack® is the world’s first genuine audio case that actually has incredible sound and top class protection in a single integrated product. The BoomPack case has a magnetic protective bicast leather cover that protects the glass screen and acts as a sturdy base for ergonomic usage. The case is also made of tough ABS plastic for durable protection.</p>
<h3>Crank Up The Volume</h3>
<p>BoomPack® triples sound quality and quadruples volume - the most unexpected punch from something so compact!</p>
<p>Watch videos and movies till your eyes and ears droop. BoomPack’s single Li-Polymer rechargeable battery is good for up for 10 hours. So don’t worry about that all-nighter. We’ve got you covered.</p>

,"<div id=""description""><h2>Parrot Zik 2.0 Wireless Headphones Features</h2><div class=""trunc_wrap""><span itemprop=""description""> <p><b>WIRELESS &amp; ERGONOMIC</b><br>
<b>When technology meets design</b><br>
To create the Parrot Zik 2.0, engineers collaborated with the French designer Philippe Starck to combine the best of audio and innovation into comfortable and trendy new headphones.<br>
Zik 2.0 are 17% lighter than the previous generation, the padded headband is thicker and more space is provided for your ears thanks to new ear cushions.<br>
<br>
<b>Bluetooth for wireless music and telephony</b><br>
Compatible with bluetooth enabled smartphones, tablets and computers: Parrot Zik 2.0 supports most audio codecs, especially AAC.<br>
Built-in NFC technology enables them to automatically connect via Bluetooth with NFC smartphones.<br>
<br>
<b>Extended listening time</b></p>

<p> </p>

<ul>
	<li>You can choose between 3 options for extended listening time:</li>
	<li>Flight mode: Up to 7 hours autonomy with ANC activated + line-in + Parrot Concert Hall effect</li>
	<li>Eco mode: Up to 7 hours autonomy with ANC activated + line-in + Parrot Concert Hall effect</li>
	<li>Regular mode: Up to 6 hours autonomy with ANC activated + Bluetooth + Parrot Concert Hall effect</li>
</ul>

<p><br>
<b>SMART-TOUCH PANEL</b><br>
<b>Simple and intuitive ergonomic</b><br>
Parrot developed a movement recognition algorithm designed to be more simple and intuitive for the user.<br>
Zik 2.0 has a head sensor in the ear cushion which automatically detects if you are wearing the headphones. As soon as you take off the Zik 2.0, the music stops!<br>
A tactile panel on the right ear cup allows you to control your music and hands-free calls.<br>
<br>
Control your music</p>

<p> </p>

<ul>
	<li>Change the track: Slide your finger horizontally to switch to the next track or return to the previous one</li>
	<li>Adjust volume: Move your finger vertically up and down to adjust the volume of your music or caller's voice</li>
	<li>Stop the music: Tap once to play or pause your music</li>
</ul>

<p>Manage your phone calls</p>

<ul>
	<li>Place a call: Hold your finger on the touch sensitive panel to activate voice recognition on your smartphone</li>
	<li>Answer calls: Tap once the touch sensitive panel to answer and end a call</li>
	<li>Reject a call: Hold your finger for 2 seconds on the touch sensitive panel to reject a call</li>
	<li>Adjust volume: Swipe your finger upwards or downwards to increase or decrease the volume</li>
</ul>

<p><b>STUNNING SOUND</b><br>
<b>Uncompromising audio quality</b><br>
To ensure music is heard in all its harmony and depth, Parrot Zik 2.0 audio playback offers full digital 32 bits audio processing. Frequency response is fully customisable with the 5 band pro-equaliser available on the free dedicated application Parrot Zik 2.0.<br>
<br>
<b>Parrot Concert Hall effect &amp; Equaliser</b><br>
The headset is equipped with powerful DSP (Digital Sound Processor) algorithms which reconstruct the sound giving you the impression that the music source is in front of you. Concert hall acoustics are recreated for harmonious and more natural sounds which also reduce fatigue. The Parrot Equaliser is a new, intuitive and fast way to adjust the music you are listening to, as well as offering you infinite settings options.<br>
<br>
<b>Smart Audio Tuning</b> Using tags from your audio files, Smart Audio Tuning in the Parrot Zik 2.0 free app automatically selects the most appropriate presets for you allowing the Parrot Zik 2.0 headphones to enhance your musical experience.<br>
If you want to create your own presets, the Parrot Zik 2.0 app lets you take control of all parameters, including the Parrot Concert Hall effect.<br>
<br>
<b>ADAPTIVE NOISE CONTROL</b><br>
<b>Uncompromising listening comfort</b><br>
Parrot offers a brand new and efficient active noise cancelling technology which adapts to your environment. Disturbing noises are eliminated whether you are at the office or in public transport for uncompromising listening comfort.<br>
<br>
<b>Enjoy a quiet environment</b><br>
6 microphones analyse residual noises (low frequencies) that could disrupt listening. Outside noise is then cancelled by opposing sound waves (anti-noise) in order to create a calmer environment.<br>
<br>
<b>Street Mode</b><br>
With Street Mode, stay connected to your environment while listening to your music. Zik 2.0 removes passive isolation effects (natural earpad isolation) to increase your perception of the environment around you. During calls, this mode offers you optimised listening comfort. The occlusion effect is removed to provide a natural perception of your own voice.<br>
<br>
<b>HANDS-FREE TELEPHONY IN HD</b><br>
<br>
<b>HD Voice</b><br>
Parrot Zik 2.0 lets you enjoy high definition hands-free calls with Bluetooth v3.0. The Sound quality is improved with HD Voice, it provides users with high-quality, crystal clear, more natural voice calls. HD voice needs to be supported by your smartphones and the phone operator.<br>
<br>
<b>Noise Reduction System</b><br>
The user's voice is captured by double microphones on each side and a bone conduction sensor. Surrounding noise is removed with a new Parrot Noise Reduction System algorithm.<br>
<br>
<b>Text-To-Speech for caller ID</b><br>
Parrot Zik 2.0 offers a vocal synthesis (Text To Speech) functionality for the selection of caller ID.<br>
<br>
<b>AUDIO PRESETS</b><br>
<b>Create and share your Presets</b><br>
Parrot Zik 2.0 are the only headphones offering the possibility to accurately customise the audio restitution. With the Producer mode, the Parrot Zik 2.0 ""mastering"" uses a 5 band full parametric equaliser with Parrot's proprietary spatialisation effect to recreate a real musical listening experience. You can also share your Presets with other Parrot Zik 2.0 users.<br>
<br>
<b>Artists Presets</b><br>
Parrot offers artists the possibility to define and share their settings in order to insure the perfect sound. Users can listen to music as heard by the artist. Follow your favourite artists through a dedicated page that features biographies and latest news about their work.<br>

<b>Hear nothing but first class sound</b><br>
Enjoy superior noise cancellation with the Fidelio NC1. All you get is uncompromised high fidelity sound, minus the noise. Compact foldability and long-wearing comfort make it the best sound companion on long haul or daily commutes.<br>
<br>
<b>Optimized 40mm neodymium drivers for high fidelity sound</b><br>
Each speaker driver is carefully hand picked, tuned and tested before being paired to ensure the most balanced natural sound. The 40mm drivers utilize high power neodymium magnets to deliver true high definition sound in a wide dynamic range, right down to the most minute details.<br>
<br>
<b>Compact multi-way folding for easy carrying and storage</b><br>
The Fidelio NC-1’s lightweight, slim and compact foldable construction in a stylish design makes it the perfect travel companion. With multiple ways of folding the headphones, you can decide how the headphones can fit efficiently in your travel bag or even in the pocket of airline seats.<br>
<br>
<b>Specially tuned for consistent high fidelity sound</b><br>
The noise cancellation feature of the Fidelio NC-1 is specially tuned with optimal sound performance in mind. Challenging the perception that noise cancelling headphones cannot deliver high performance sound, the NC-1 is engineered to deliver the best audio quality whether you’re in a quiet or noisy environment.<br>
<br>
<b>In-line control and mic switches you between music and calls</b><br>
With the in-line control and mic, you can easily switch between your music and phone calls. Fidelio’s superb noise cancellation lets you enjoy crystal clear calls even in bustling environments.<br>
<br>
<b>Standalone acoustic chamber for sound precision</b><br>
The Fidelio NC-1’s standalone acoustic chamber ensures that sound is not affected by its components for active noise cancellation. Every natural sound detail is isolated and precise, dynamic bass is intact – without any compromising on sound clarity.<br>
<br>
<b>Hybrid technology for superior noise cancellation</b><br>
Fidelio NC-1 uses a feed-forward and feed-backward active noise cancellation (ANC) solution, which means there are 4 microphones implemented inside and outside the ear cans to capture noise for advanced processing. The feed-forward ANC (mic outside the ear can) covers a wider bandwidth of frequencies, while the feed-backward ANC (mic inside the ear can) provides fortified noise cancellation. This combination ensures cancellation over a wide frequency range and to a deeper extent for optimized music enjoyment in any environment.<br>

,"<div id=""description""><h2>Parrot Zik 2.0 Wireless Headphones Features</h2><div class=""trunc_wrap""><span itemprop=""description""> <p><b>WIRELESS &amp; ERGONOMIC</b><br>
<b>When technology meets design</b><br>
To create the Parrot Zik 2.0, engineers collaborated with the French designer Philippe Starck to combine the best of audio and innovation into comfortable and trendy new headphones.<br>
Zik 2.0 are 17% lighter than the previous generation, the padded headband is thicker and more space is provided for your ears thanks to new ear cushions.<br>
<br>
<b>Bluetooth for wireless music and telephony</b><br>
Compatible with bluetooth enabled smartphones, tablets and computers: Parrot Zik 2.0 supports most audio codecs, especially AAC.<br>
Built-in NFC technology enables them to automatically connect via Bluetooth with NFC smartphones.<br>
<br>
<b>Extended listening time</b></p>

<p> </p>

<ul>
	<li>You can choose between 3 options for extended listening time:</li>
	<li>Flight mode: Up to 7 hours autonomy with ANC activated + line-in + Parrot Concert Hall effect</li>
	<li>Eco mode: Up to 7 hours autonomy with ANC activated + line-in + Parrot Concert Hall effect</li>
	<li>Regular mode: Up to 6 hours autonomy with ANC activated + Bluetooth + Parrot Concert Hall effect</li>
</ul>

<p><br>
<b>SMART-TOUCH PANEL</b><br>
<b>Simple and intuitive ergonomic</b><br>
Parrot developed a movement recognition algorithm designed to be more simple and intuitive for the user.<br>
Zik 2.0 has a head sensor in the ear cushion which automatically detects if you are wearing the headphones. As soon as you take off the Zik 2.0, the music stops!<br>
A tactile panel on the right ear cup allows you to control your music and hands-free calls.<br>
<br>
Control your music</p>

<p> </p>

<ul>
	<li>Change the track: Slide your finger horizontally to switch to the next track or return to the previous one</li>
	<li>Adjust volume: Move your finger vertically up and down to adjust the volume of your music or caller's voice</li>
	<li>Stop the music: Tap once to play or pause your music</li>

	<li>Adjust volume: Swipe your finger upwards or downwards to increase or decrease the volume</li>
</ul>

<p><b>STUNNING SOUND</b><br>
<b>Uncompromising audio quality</b><br>
To ensure music is heard in all its harmony and depth, Parrot Zik 2.0 audio playback offers full digital 32 bits audio processing. Frequency response is fully customisable with the 5 band pro-equaliser available on the free dedicated application Parrot Zik 2.0.<br>
<br>
<b>Parrot Concert Hall effect &amp; Equaliser</b><br>
The headset is equipped with powerful DSP (Digital Sound Processor) algorithms which reconstruct the sound giving you the impression that the music source is in front of you. Concert hall acoustics are recreated for harmonious and more natural sounds which also reduce fatigue. The Parrot Equaliser is a new, intuitive and fast way to adjust the music you are listening to, as well as offering you infinite settings options.<br>
<br>
<b>Smart Audio Tuning</b> Using tags from your audio files, Smart Audio Tuning in the Parrot Zik 2.0 free app automatically selects the most appropriate presets for you allowing the Parrot Zik 2.0 headphones to enhance your musical experience.<br>
If you want to create your own presets, the Parrot Zik 2.0 app lets you take control of all parameters, including the Parrot Concert Hall effect.<br>
<br>
<b>ADAPTIVE NOISE CONTROL</b><br>
<b>Uncompromising listening comfort</b><br>
Parrot offers a brand new and efficient active noise cancelling technology which adapts to your environment. Disturbing noises are eliminated whether you are at the office or in public transport for uncompromising listening comfort.<br>
<br>
<b>Enjoy a quiet environment</b><br>
6 microphones analyse residual noises (low frequencies) that could disrupt listening. Outside noise is then cancelled by opposing sound waves (anti-noise) in order to create a calmer environment.<br>
<br>
<b>Street Mode</b><br>
With Street Mode, stay connected to your environment while listening to your music. Zik 2.0 removes passive isolation effects (natural earpad isolation) to increase your perception of the environment around you. During calls, this mode offers you optimised listening comfort. The occlusion effect is removed to provide a natural perception of your own voice.<br>
<br>
<b>HANDS-FREE TELEPHONY IN HD</b><br>
<br>
<b>HD Voice</b><br>
Parrot Zik 2.0 lets you enjoy high definition hands-free calls with Bluetooth v3.0. The Sound quality is improved with HD Voice, it provides users with high-quality, crystal clear, more natural voice calls. HD voice needs to be supported by your smartphones and the phone operator.<br>
<br>
<b>Noise Reduction System</b><br>
The user's voice is captured by double microphones on each side and a bone conduction sensor. Surrounding noise is removed with a new Parrot Noise Reduction System algorithm.<br>
<br>
<b>Text-To-Speech for caller ID</b><br>
Parrot Zik 2.0 offers a vocal synthesis (Text To Speech) functionality for the selection of caller ID.<br>
<br>
<b>AUDIO PRESETS</b><br>
<b>Create and share your Presets</b><br>
Parrot Zik 2.0 are the only headphones offering the possibility to accurately customise the audio restitution. With the Producer mode, the Parrot Zik 2.0 ""mastering"" uses a 5 band full parametric equaliser with Parrot's proprietary spatialisation effect to recreate a real musical listening experience. You can also share your Presets with other Parrot Zik 2.0 users.<br>
<br>
<b>Artists Presets</b><br>
Parrot offers artists the possibility to define and share their settings in order to insure the perfect sound. Users can listen to music as heard by the artist. Follow your favourite artists through a dedicated page that features biographies and latest news about their work.<br>

<b>FEEL YOUR MUSIC</b><br>
The Beats Acoustic Engine™ makes your listening experience personal and real. Our signature DSP software is designed to generate the emotional experience that some of the music industry's greatest rock, hip-hop, pop, electronic, and R n B producers want you to feel. This is how music would sound if the artist could play it back for you in person.<br>
<br>

<b>PUT THE WORLD ON MUTE</b><br>
Silence the noise from your daily commute or the drama from your loud neighbors with dual-mode Adaptive Noise Canceling. When you are listening to music, ANC automatically strikes the perfect blend between your music and the world outside. If you only want to use the headphone to cancel external noise, the ANC only mode automatically increases the level of noise cancelation, to put the world on mute.<br>
<br>

<b>WHAT BATTERIES?</b><br>
Dead batteries can kill your vibe. The new Beats Studio Wireless comes with a built-in rechargeable battery that lasts 12 hours when using wirelessly and 20 hours when you do decide to plug in. To prevent wasting energy, the Auto On/Off feature turns the headphone off when you unplug from a wired connection and with the Battery Fuel Gauge, you always know how much juice is left. Forget specialized adapters; the Studio Wireless can be charged via micro USB almost anywhere.<br>
<br>

<b>LIGHTER, STRONGER, AND MORE COMFORTABLE</b><br>
When we reimagined the iconic Studio, we designed it like a beautiful sports car and made disciplined choices. It is streamlined with fast curves, smooth surfaces, and no visible screws. We reduced the original weight and gave it a lighter, stronger, and more comfortable headband. The softer ear cups have an ergonomic bellow that creates a flexible custom fit, so you can keep your music all to yourself.<br>

When you are listening to music, ANC automatically strikes the perfect blend between your music and the world outside. If you only want to use the headphone to cancel external noise, the ANC only mode automatically increases the level of noise cancelation, to put the world on mute.<br>
<br>

<b>WHAT BATTERIES?</b><br>
Dead batteries can kill your vibe. The new Beats Studio Wireless comes with a built-in rechargeable battery that lasts 12 hours when using wirelessly and 20 hours when you do decide to plug in. To prevent wasting energy, the Auto On/Off feature turns the headphone off when you unplug from a wired connection and with the Battery Fuel Gauge, you always know how much juice is left. Forget specialized adapters; the Studio Wireless can be charged via micro USB almost anywhere.<br>
<br>

<b>LIGHTER, STRONGER, AND MORE COMFORTABLE</b><br>
When we reimagined the iconic Studio, we designed it like a beautiful sports car and made disciplined choices. It is streamlined with fast curves, smooth surfaces, and no visible screws. We reduced the original weight and gave it a lighter, stronger, and more comfortable headband. The softer ear cups have an ergonomic bellow that creates a flexible custom fit, so you can keep your music all to yourself.<br>

  emails, text messages, and calls all remotely. The battery will also keep running as long as you can, and even longer, being
  powered by a 300mAh Lithium-Ion battery that should keep you going for two days at a time. 
</p>
<p>
  The Samsung Gear S is also bringing to the table features like the new Tizen-based wearable platform, GPS (with A-GPS and

The Apple iPhone 6 Plus is one of the latest iPhone release for 2014 and brings the performance you expect from an iPhone to a much bigger screen.<br>
<br>
The iPhone 6 Plus is dressed to the nines with a large 5.5” LED-Backlit IPS LCD Shatterproof Oleophobic Capacitive Touchscreen with Multitouch capabilities and Retina Display donning an enormous 401ppi. This screen is cased in stylish blushed aluminum; and for those environmentally conscientious, yes, it is recycled aluminum.  The iPhone 6 Plus’ size is also manageable being only 158.1 x 77.8 x 7.1mm and weighing in at a mere 172g.<br>
<br>
The beauty of the iPhone 6 Plus is also matched with the power that runs it. It is ran off a Dual-Core version of Apple’s latest chip: the A8; and is accented with the M8 Motion Coprocessor. This should bring plenty of power for Apples 8MP camera they installed on this beast. The back camera is a revolutionary iSight camera with 1.5µ pixels and an f/2.2 aperture.<br>

 <li>Replacement Battery</li>
 <li>Connects with iOS and specific Android smart phones</li>
</ul><br>
Bright, clean and visually striking, the EZIO Osprey brings highly technical construction together with ergonomic and fresh elegance. Pure white leather strap leads the eye to an aquamarine, art deco, aluminium bezel. Classic black leather straps empower the black watch face and off set either the green or red accents. In homage to the bird of prey they are named after; the Osprey range are renowned for their striking silhouettes and visually striking presence. Perfect for making a powerful statement, the post-modern, art deco design is at the forefront of timepiece style. Brightly coloured, sand blasted aluminium bezels steal the centre stage of these fun designs. The EZIO Osprey allows you to defy the ordinary and search out your own dreams. Fly above the constraints of the expected, dare to reach new heights. If life is too small, too claustrophobic, then the EZIO Osprey will help take you to the heights you aspire too.<br>
<br>
When you realize that you missed an important call you were waiting for because you did not hear your phone ring or you forgot that you had it on vibrate in your purse or computer bag. The EZIO Bluetooth 4.0 Smart Watch solves this common dilemma with a technically advanced watch that uses Bluetooth Technology to link to your phone. Incoming calls and messages trigger an alert on the watch face so you never miss a call or email again. Additionally, the EZIO Bluetooth 4.0 Smart Watch has a proximity feature. If you leave your phone in a cab or at a restaurant, the watch immediately alerts you that your phone is no longer within a 5-10 foot radius of your person (depending on if you are indoors or outside). The EZIO Bluetooth 4.0 Smart Watch features a stainless steel watch face with genuine leather bands.<br>

COGITO CLASSIC brings together the power of a connected watch with the sophistication of a precision-crafted timepiece, seamlessly uniting classic analog movement and intuitive digital notifications. When paired with the app, users can manage a wide range of smartphone functions directly on their wrist — call notifications, social media and message alerts (Facebook, Twitter, Skype, WhatsApp, WeChat), music control, camera activation and more. On the watch
face, users can track their step count.<br>
<br>
The new CONNECTED WATCH app enables the watch's activity monitor. Now you can track your steps, high and low activity levels, and better manage your sleep. When linked with the smartphone or tablet app, COGITO CLASSIC allows you to cut through the digital noise by customizing settings based on your priorities and selecting which notifications will appear. On the watch face, you can see who is calling and decide whether to answer or mute it [with Android]. COGITO CLASSIC frees you from continually checking your phone. Features may vary depending on version of operating system and device.<br>
<br>
The COGITO Watch uses Bluetooth® 4.0 LE wireless technology and compatible with mobile devices that support Bluetooth Smart technology including iOS 7 devices that support Bluetooth® Smart technology such as the iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone 5s, 5c &amp; 5, iPhone 4s, iPad mini, iPad (3rd and 4th generation), and iPod touch (5th generation); Android 4.3 and later devices such as Samsung Galaxy series, LG G Series, Google Nexus 4 and 5, HTC One and Max, Motorola G and X, XiaoMi Mi3 and HongMii.

Pure white leather strap leads the eye to an aquamarine, art deco, aluminium bezel. Classic black leather straps empower the black watch face and off set either the green or red accents. In homage to the bird of prey they are named after; the Osprey range are renowned for their striking silhouettes and visually striking presence. Perfect for making a powerful statement, the post-modern, art deco design is at the forefront of timepiece style. Brightly coloured, sand blasted aluminium bezels steal the centre stage of these fun designs. The EZIO Osprey allows you to defy the ordinary and search out your own dreams. Fly above the constraints of the expected, dare to reach new heights. If life is too small, too claustrophobic, then the EZIO Osprey will help take you to the heights you aspire too.<br>

Real music aficionados get so immersed in their music that it’s easy to spend hours enjoying your favourite tunes in pristine quality. At Denon we believe you should feel the music, not your headphones. In a quest to provide the most comfortable, best fitting headphones, Denon’s engineers have studied over 4,000 pairs of ears from people around the world to come up with a design that automatically accounts for the subtle differences in ear shape, placement, canal size, head size and jaw depression. We know that fit and comfort comes from paying attention to the small details. Denon’s Music Maniac AH-C120 In-Ear headphones come with a multitude of ear tips to choose from you can get the right custom fit. Choose from Comply Foam ear TX-400M ear tips or Silicon Ear Tips (S, M, L). A diminutive carrying case is also included for extreme portability.</p>

Denon’s Audio App, for iPhone, iPad or Android, enhances your experience.<br>

,"<div id=""description""><h2>Garmin Forerunner 620 GPS Watch with HRM-Run™ Features</h2><div class=""trunc_wrap""><span itemprop=""description"">Forerunner 620 features recovery advisor, race predictor and VO2 max estimate so you can train smarter. When used with the HRM-Run monitor, the 620 also gives you feedback on your running form by showing your cadence, ground contact time and vertical oscillation. For indoor training, the built-in accelerometer tracks distance, so you don’t need a separate foot pod.<br>
<br>
Forerunner 620 can estimate your VO2 max, your body’s maximal oxygen consumption. Knowing your VO2 max is a great way to measure your physical fitness and improve your performance. When used with a heart rate monitor, the 620 crunches data, including your running speed, beats per minute and heart rate variability to estimate your VO2 max. The number itself indicates the maximum volume of oxygen you can consume per minute, per kilogram of body weight at your max performance.<br>
<br>
With Forerunner 620, you don’t have to guess how much recovery time you need between workouts. It knows your physiology based on your heart rate data, so it factors this against your last workout and then shows how much time before you are fully recovered and ready for your next hard running workout.<br>
<br>

<li>Touchscreen GPS running watch with high-resolution colour display that tracks distance, pace and heart rate</li>

<br>
<b>Small, yet robust with a great personality</b><br>
Jumping Sumo offers 2 different experiences with its adjustable wheels: depending on your level of experience you can opt for stability (wheels unfolded) or speed (wheels folded). Thanks to its sturdy, shock-proof design you can jump, roll, spin and explore without stopping. What is even more amazing is that Jumping Sumo always lands on its wheels. Equipped with a gyroscope and high-speed processor, the pilot can make the most of its fool-proof agility and super-intuitive driving control.
Jumping Sumo reveals its cheeky personality through its flashing LED lights and sounds. Don't hesitate to personalize your robot with a range of stickers depending on your mood! Program your own animations and choreograph different moves and tricks to fascinate your spectators.<br>

<p><span style=""line-height: 1.6em;"">INCREDIBLY COMPACT. UNBELIEVABLY LIGHT</span><strong><span style=""line-height: 1.6em;""> </span></strong></p>

<p>Weighing just 5 pounds (2.3kg), about half the weight of the original Ronin, the slimmed down Ronin-M is small enough to fit into your backpack and take anywhere, yet strong enough to support camera setups weighing up to 8 pounds (3.6kg).</p>

<p>FAST SETUP, PRECISE BALANCING </p>

<p>Save time and start shooting professionally stabilized video in under 5 minutes. Mount your camera to the Ronin-M, quickly balance it, and then tap a button. The upgraded ATS (Auto Tune Stability) technology is more precise than before and completes the tuning and balancing processes with no tools necessary. Easy and efficient.</p>

<p>SIMPLE DISASSEMBLY FOR UNMATCHED FLEXIBILITY </p>

<p>Capture tight shots, even when you have almost no space to work, and easily transport your Ronin-M. The top handle bars quickly and easily twist off, allowing you to minimize its size, achieve different shooting configurations, and pack or unpack it in seconds.</p>

<p>NEW MAGNESIUM FRAME </p>

<p>Your Ronin-M stands up to rugged use in any filming environment. Featuring a superbly strong and rigid magnesium frame, the Ronin-M brings increased stiffness and reduced weight. Notoriously difficult to manufacture and mold, magnesium brings you a new, more exact shooting experience while maintaining easy maneuverability and increasing options on set.</p>

<p>SOLID SUPPORT ARM </p>

<p>I<span style=""line-height: 1.6em;"">ncreased rigidity is provided by a single, complete piece of fine-tooled magnesium that forms the U-shaped arm holding the camera plate. Only made possible by </span>DJI's<span style=""line-height: 1.6em;""> large manufacturing reach and expertise, this unified design eliminates imperfections that are common in systems made of multiple pieces assembled together. This arm gives you not only greater stability but also reliability, as there is no potential for separate pieces to come loose or move apart.</span></p>

<p>SMOOTHTRACK CONTROL </p>

<p>Even with only one operator, SmoothTrack technology ensures the Ronin-M translates your movements into smooth camera angle changes. Your camera intuitively faces the direction you want, all while completely stabilized, no matter how you move. SmoothTrack settings from speed to deadband to acceleration are fully customizable, and 'Single Axis Follow Mode' enables you to lock two axes while SmoothTrack guides your camera along only one axis of motion.</p>

<p>ENDLESS SHOOTING SCENARIOS. ONE FLEXIBLE SOLUTION </p>

<p>Capture shots that are impossible with any other setup. Switch effortlessly between the 3 modes of operation, without adjusting any settings or needing a 2nd operator remote.</p>

<p>LONG BATTERY LIFE </p>

<p>Film all day, until you get every shot, with the Ronin-M's smart battery and a runtime of over 6 hours. Overcharge and over depletion protection is built in, as is individual cell charge balancing. Remaining power is shown by clear LEDs and in the Assistant mobile app.</p>

<p>POWERFUL MOTORS. PRECISION CONTROL </p>

<p>Designed with high performance in mind, the Ronin-M's brushless motors are incredibly precise and powerful while maintaining low vibration and increasing torque. Industry-leading accuracy is increased even further with Digital Absolute Positioning Encoders in each axis, and a much larger range of controllable motion on both the tilt (105° Up, 165° Down) and roll (± 110°) axes.</p>

<p>SILENT MODE </p>

<p>When shooting indoors or in tight spaces, a new Silent Mode reduces the sound of each motor to almost inaudible levels. The Ronin-M's stabilization algorithms are instantly changed to focus on strength for minute changes and stabilization, ensuring the sound of the motors is not recorded by sensitive microphones or other recording equipment.</p>

<p>SECOND OPERATOR FOR IMPOSSIBLE SHOTS </p>

<p>Capture anything you can imagine with a second operator controlling the camera's movements as the first operator moves around set. Achieve perfect framing and complete more complex camera movements by working together and making your camera's motions completely independent of the person holding it.</p>

<p>MOUNTS TO ANYTHING </p>

<p>Easily mount your Ronin-M with a quick-release system that is compatible with a wide range of universal connections. Remove the top bar assembly in seconds and put your Ronin-M on a jib, crane, tripod, or anything else.</p>

<p>POWER YOUR TOOLS </p>

<p>A dedicated power distribution box keeps wiring to a minimum while providing power to your key accessories. Two regulated 12V P-taps, one 500mAH full-size USB connector, and a DJI Lightbridge connector enable you to connect and provide power to everything you need.</p>

<p>BLUETOOTH APP </p>

<p>Change settings on the go with the simple DJI Assistant app that links to your Ronin-M over Bluetooth. Auto Tune, adjust your favorite settings, monitor the status of your Ronin-M, and customize SmoothTrack in seconds.</p>

<p>FUTURE-PROOFING WITH UPGRADABLE FIRMWARE </p>

<p>Take advantage of new features and updates by downloading the latest firmware online and updating your Ronin-M instantly.</p>

<p>COMPATIBLE THUMB CONTROLLER </p>

<p>Gain more control over your camera's motions with a built-in receiver that is fully compatible with the optional DJI Ronin Thumb Controller. Point the camera in any direction and save preset settings for fast, easy operation.</p>

<p>
  The H4-3D gimbal comes customized for the DJI Phantom 2.<br>
  Fly with your GoPro. Works with the GoPro® Hero4 Black camera.
</p>
<h3><strong>Features</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>3-AXIS STABILIZATION </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Forget shaky, unusable aerial footage. Fly your GoPro®  Hero4 Black with this gimbal and capture smooth, stable content
  like never before. Your camera is stabilized to prevent unwanted roll, tilt, and pan motions, giving you the confidence to fly
  difficult maneuvers and get the shots you want.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>EASY TO SETUP </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Simply mount the gimbal to your flight platform, attach your camera, and you're ready to fly. Your H4-3D gimbal is calibrated and
  pre-programmed to work right out of the box.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>CROSS-PLATFORM COMPATIBILITY </li>
</ul>
<p>
  The H4-3D is compatible with most DJI platforms, including the Phantom 2 and Flame Wheel systems with the A2, WooKong-M, or
  NAZA-M flight controllers.*
</p>
<ul>
  <li>TRUSTED ZENMUSE TECHNOLOGY </li>
</ul>
<p>
  DJI's Zenmuse technology is the most trusted among filmmakers and enthusiasts worldwide when it comes to aerial camera
  stabilization. Our patented sensors, advanced algorithms, and custom-built gimbal motors give you unmatched stability and
  reliability in the air.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>INDEPENDENT IMU </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Camera stabilization is impossible without tracking how your aircraft is being tilted and moved in real time. That's why the
  H4-3D has its own integrated Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) constantly collecting precise information and feeding it to the
  gimbal. This IMU tells the gimbal exactly how you're moving in the sky and how much countering force is required to keep your
  camera still, every millisecond.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>SMALL, LIGHTWEIGHT, DURABLE </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Engineered to add a minimal amount of payload weight to your flight platform, the H4-3D maximizes flight time without sacrificing
  quality. By combining a compact yet high strength aluminum body with a high level of durability, you fly knowing that your camera
  is secure.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>DOWNLOADABLE UPDATES </li>
</ul>
<p>
  DJI is constantly working to improve your experience and help you get the most out of your systems. Free firmware updates are
  available for your H4-3D at the click of a mouse and ensure you are at the forefront of this technology.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>OPTIONAL GCU MODULE </li>
</ul>
<p>
  The Zenmuse H4-3D gimbal is customized for the DJI Phantom 2 and does not include the optional Gimbal Control Unit (GCU). If you
  want to use your H4-3D with other DJI flight controllers and flight platforms, the independent GCU module is required and sold
  separately.

<h3>What we like about the LG G5:</h3>
<ul class=""for_list"">
<li><b>Stylish metal design with slide-out replaceable battery and USB Type-C port</b></li>
<li><b>Dual rear camera with 135-degree wide angle lens</b></li>
<li><b>Always-on display access time, date, notifications at a glance</b></li>
</ul>
</div>
<b>Always-on Display for Enhanced Convenience</b><br>
The 5.3-inch Quad HD IPS Quantum display on the LG G5 offers an Always-on feature, the first on a main smartphone display. Save your thumbs. No more hitting the button to check the time, date, or notifications. With the LG G5, the important stuff is already up and on! Just look.<br>
<br>
<b>LG’s First Modular Type Smartphone</b><br>
LG’s innovative Modular Type design gives the LG G5 the ability to transform into a digital camera, Hi-Fi player and more all while keeping its traditional removable battery in a full metal uni-body design for the first time ever.<br>
<br>
<b>Extreme Wide Angle Lens and Advanced UX</b><br>
Reflecting LG’s longstanding reputation as a leader in smartphone cameras, the LG G5 has two cameras on the rear: one with a standard 78-degree lens and another with a 135-degree wide angle lens, the widest available in any smartphone. The 135-degree lens on the LG G5 offers a viewing angle that is approximately 1.7 times wider than those of existing smartphone cameras and 15 degrees wider than the human eye’s field of view. The wide angle lens makes it easier for users to capture more landscape, taller buildings or larger groups without having to position oneself further from the subject.</span><ul id=""p_details""><li>Shipping Weight:<strong> 0.46kg</strong></li></ul></div></div>","LG G5 (Unlocked, 32GB, Titan)",http://www.expansys.com.sg/lg-g5-unlocked-32gb-titan-288130/,,http://i1.expansys.com/img/b/288130/lg-g5.jpg,"http://i.expansys.com/i/b/b288130.jpg,http://i.expansys.com/i/b/b288130-1.jpg,http://i.expansys.com/i/b/b288130-2.jpg,http://i.expansys.com/i/b/b288130-3.jpg,http://i.expansys.com/i/b/b288130-4.jpg",288130,,2016-03-09 04:04:37,False,Price Not Announced,,"Home,Mobile Phones,SIM Free Phones,Android,Marshmallow 6.0"

80.0,"<div id=""description""><h2>Sony SBH80 Stereo Bluetooth Headset Features</h2><div class=""trunc_wrap""><span itemprop=""description""><b>Premium listening experience and optimal wearability.</b><br>
<br>
<b>Wear it. Enjoy it</b><br>
<br>
Designed to be worn and used all day and in any situation, the SBH80 is discreet and suits any type of clothing style. Wear it at
work, at home, indoors or outdoors. The main unit and headphone exterior are splash-proof so you don't have to worry if it rains.
Worn on the neck, this Bluetooth® wireless headset is perfectly balanced; two ultra-thin smart-memory metal strips rest lightly
on your shoulders. You hardly know it's there. The SBH80 adapts itself to your body and stays there.<br>
<br>
<b>Superior Sony sound</b><br>
<br>
It's not just the optimal wearability, stunning Sony craftsmanship and ease of use that makes this Bluetooth® wireless headset
great. The sound is superb. The SBH80 has aptX™ audio enhancement, a high-quality audio codec designed to deliver a flawless
wireless experience. Enjoy music as it was meant to be enjoyed – with pure deep bass and clean clear highs.<br>
<br>
<b>Ground-breaking audio technology</b><br>
<br>
Balanced armature drivers in the SBH80 deliver the clarity and frequency accuracy required for the best in-ear audio experience.
And with specially made double-layer housings, made of high-strength magnesium, you get crystal clear mid to high range sound and
overall rich audio. The materials and form of the ear buds in these premium headphones are designed for maximum background noise
cancelling. Sealing of the ear opening is so perfect that all you get is the best quality music experience.<br>
<br>
<b>Best quality calling</b><br>
<br>
Stereo Bluetooth® Headset SBH80 is HD Voice ready. HD Voice, also known as wideband audio, lets the person you're talking to
experience your voice as it really sounds – natural. HD Voice fades or cuts out background noises and makes it easy to recognise
voices. The SBH80 has double microphones. Whichever way your head is turned you're always close to the microphone, so your caller
gets a clear and even calling experience. A vibrating alert in the main unit discreetly lets you know when a call or notification
comes in. These premium headphones make calling more comfortable and more enjoyable. * Full HD Voice compliance is dependent on
phone and network service availability.<br>
<br>
<b>Use it. Make life easy</b><br>
<br>
When you want to connect your SBH80 to your smartphone, simply touch the phone against the main unit of this Bluetooth®
wireless headset and it starts up and connects. Make your day wireless and your life easy. When a call comes in, press the answer
key just under the headphone. The SBH80 also has responsive music remote controls and call/music volume controls.<br>
<br>
<b>Multi-compatible</b><br>
<br>
Stereo Bluetooth® Headset SBH80 is compatible with all of the most popular smartphones, tablets and laptops. It supports
Bluetooth Multipoint, allowing you to connect to two or more devices at the same time. <br>
